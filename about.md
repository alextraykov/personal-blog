I'm a multidisciplinary designer focused on UI/UX. Solving user problems, while building visually pleasing designs has been my main goal since the beginning of my career. I'm constantly searching for new paths that will expand my skill set. You can check out my Twitter, where I'm being socially awkward. ([@alextraykov](https://twitter.com/alextraykov)).
