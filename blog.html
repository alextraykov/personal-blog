                        <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">I was hired by Pruvit to improve and update the visual design for both Android and iOS. Currently,
                            I'm expanding the iOS Design Component System, which is based on HIGwith some custom components
                            as design as well. I'm continuing to work on the Material Design Component System. We decided
                            to create and implement component based systems because it has the vast benefits of reusability,
                            consistency throughout the designs and the mindblowing speed regarding iteration in Sketch. On
                            top of that since Sketch introduced libraries the reusability of components scales to multiple
                            designers and with version control apps like Abstract it has huge benefits. After the completion
                            of the update for Pruvit Pulse, I had a task to design another app for Pruvit - Pruvit Learn.</p>

                        In the beginning of our work my task was to transfer the designed elements from Photoshop to Sketch (this basically meant
                        that I had to redesign them all again). When I was done redesigning them, I had to categorize them
                        in a sense. That was my first touch with any form of component systematization. Before I began any
                        kind of organizational process, I converted all of the designed components into Symbols. Please review
                        the example below:</p>

                        <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">After the first week of hype, when I had this "design-hype" of using the combination of Sketch Runner
                            and the reusable components I made, I started to encounter some problems. The issue I encountered
                            was that I had to detach a lot of the symbols I made, so I could do a small change on them. After
                            the change was done I converted the new symbol, so I had literally two symbols that their only
                            difference was, for example, that one of them had a blue paragraph element and the other had
                            black. This worried me since it increased the size of the system significantly, it was hard to
                            define the names of components and in general, I was making a mess. In that moment of time, I
                            encountered the idea of symbol nesting and it's magic.</p>

                            With basic symbol nesting, I was able to design most of my components to follow a similar logic when used. In our case that's
                            all we've needed, since a lot of the time we're focusing on rapid prototyping and iterative design.
                            When I had to showcase some sort of interactivity with an element, I had to detach the symbols
                            again. This is why I decided to work this out the other way around - every time a repeatable
                            interactivity pattern occured, I transformed it into symbols. With this decision, I made myself
                            the future favour when encountering the same/similar interaction pattern in the building process
                            of other Pruvit apps.</p>

                        After we had the base wireframes for the mobile, we iterated on the component placement on the page, until we found the exact
                        the layout we were looking for.</p>

                            When I began working side by side with Pruvit's team, we were just implementing new features like Chat, Contacts and new
                            Newsfeed. I remember that I designed many screens that got scraped in the search of a better
                            pattern or layout. Implementing new features can be described like this - A loop of "Communicate
                            - Itterate".</p>
