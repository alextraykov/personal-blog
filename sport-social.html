                            removes the pain of searching for a specific gym with a combination of a seamless interface and
                            having all the gym data needed in the app itself. My role was to set a visual style and design
                            the whole system. I collaborated with the founder and the dev team to launch this project.</p>

                    <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">
                        I created low fidelity wireframes to iterate through most of the layout options. Since SportSocial had no set of brand colours
                        but had a logo I went for the green. From there I build the rest of the colours. After the colour
                        selection was done I tackled the typography. Since the project is directly related to sports, the
                        type had to be strong, bold and confident. I picked the geometric font of Montserrat combined with
                        the perfectly legible Roboto. The team behind SportSocial loved the combination of this bold, rounded
                        heading font width the subtle yet readable body font. After distilling the visual research I created
                        the first mid-fidelity wireframes using Sketch and InVision to iterate through the flow and layout
                        of the app. Working with the CEO, who was managing the project as well, we used the wireframes to
                        discuss our product strategy.</p>

                        <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">After we were done with the mid fidelity wireframes we started to prototype the designs in InVision.
                            In this process we focused on usability, interactivity and accesability. When all the needed
                            fixes were done I unified the design style in a small styleguide. The style guide was really
                            useful in the development stage, since the devs needed the exact values of the elements of the
                            page.

                            With basic symbol nesting, I was able to design most of my components to follow a similar logic when used. In our case that's
                            all we've needed, since a lot of the time we're focusing on rapid prototyping and iterative design.
                            When I had to showcase some sort of interactivity with an element, I had to detach the symbols
                            again. This is why I decided to work this out the other way around - every time a repeatable
                            interactivity pattern occured, I transformed it into symbols. With this decision, I made myself
                            the future favour when encountering the same/similar interaction pattern in the building process
                            of other Pruvit apps.</p>

                        After we had the base wireframes for the mobile, we iterated on the component placement on the page, until we found the exact
                        the layout we were looking for.</p>

                            When I began working side by side with Pruvit's team, we were just implementing new features like Chat, Contacts and new
                            Newsfeed. I remember that I designed many screens that got scraped in the search of a better
                            pattern or layout. Implementing new features can be described like this - A loop of "Communicate
                            - Itterate".</p>
