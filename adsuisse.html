                    <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">The first thing we did was to set up a moodboard for both the visuals (illustrations) and the web design
                        itself. With this sort of process we managed to define key aspects of the website's style in no time.</p>

                    <div id="section3">
                        <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">Our main inspiration was Stipe’s designs. The way they combine different visual components like color
                            and typography is on a whole new design level. In my opinion, Stripe has one of the best visual
                            design teams in the world. We started with low fidelity wireframes. The first task at hand was
                            the layout exploration. I iterated the possible layouts, and of course, I started with the mobile
                            view. Side note: I believe it is of great importance to understand the benefits of starting a
                            design from mobile first view.</p>

                            Initially, we started with some rough wireframes so we could decide how we’re going to lay the content out. I believe that
                            it’s mandatory to have the whole website copy before starting to design because you can take
                            some decisions upfront like:</p>
                        <img class="image center pb4" src="images/adsuisse-mobile-wireframes.png"> </div>
                    <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">
                        After we had the base wireframes for the mobile, we iterated on the component placement on the page, until we found the exact
                        the layout we were looking for.</p>
                    <p class="f3 lh-title pb2 m">Tablet</p>
                    <div id="section5">
                        <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">
                            When we had the necessary wireframe for the mobile viewport, we easily upscaled to tablet. Thanks to the tablet view (or
                            it’s dimensions) we took some solid decisions about the layout for desktop as well, as on many
                            pages we’ve just upscaled part of the components for desktop.</p>

                        <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">
                            Desktop was the most fun, interaction wise. I had the idea to show cards with interactivity like slide through, hovers and
                            opacity scrolls (which was ditched due to technical reasons from the dev team, but it would have
                            been awesome) See more in the Final State of Work.</p>

                            While in this state of work, we experimented a lot with colors, gradients and the idea of wavy gradient background which
                            Is inspired by the company’s logo. I had a set of pre-defined brand colors that I had to follow
                            as well. After we managed to set the type scale, font weights, the grid and the general style
                            of all the components of the website (like image blocks, illustration blocks, text blocks, etc.)
                            I switched my focus mainly on interactivity.</p>

                    <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">
                        In the final stage of work on ADSuisse, when we had the colors, type scale and font weights, the grid setup and all the component
                        styles approved I got to the illustration implementation and the interactivity of the elements on
                        the page.</p>

                    <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">
                        The illustration implementation was relatively easy since we decided what positions they're going to take beforehand. I had
                        some general issues with the svg's while importing them from Illustrator to Sketch. The role those
                        lovely visual components played was tremendous. Since the idea was to present the business of the
                        company in a fun, warm, welcoming way, the illustrations were the key element. Now let's talk about
                        interactivity. I'm a big fan of animation, interaction and general motion in websites. I believe
                        users benefit from animations; they retain their focus more (of course if the animations/interactions
                        are not overly complicated/too heavy) The website would have never been what it is, without her touch.
