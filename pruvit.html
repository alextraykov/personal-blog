            <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">I was hired by Pruvit as an UI/UX Designer. My job was to improve and update the visual design for both Android
                and iOS and find any loop-holes or bad patterns and suggest a fix. Currently, I'm expanding the iOS Design
                Component System, which is based on HIG with some custom components as design as well. I'm continuing to
                work on the Material Design Component System, epsiecially since Google updated their design system. Pruvit
                took the decision to create and implement a component-based systems because it has the vast benefits of reusability,
                consistency throughout the designs and the mindblowing speed regarding iteration in Sketch. On top of that,
                since Sketch introduced libraries the reusability of components scale to multiple designers and with version
                control apps like Abstract, it has enormous benefits.

        <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">
            At the beginning of our work, my task was to transfer the designed elements from Photoshop to Sketch. It was a long and beneficial
            process, since I had to design the components all over again, which gave me the ability to suggest bettern interaction
            patterns for some of them. When the component transfer was done, I had to give some order to our component library.
            That was my first touch with any form of component systematization. Before I began any kind of organizational
            process, I converted all of the designed components into Symbols. Please review the example below:</p>

            <p class="f4 lh-copy pb2">After the first week of using the combination of Sketch Runner and the reusable components I made, I started
                to encounter some problems. The issue I faced was that I had to detach a lot of the symbols I made so I could
                do a small change on them. After the shift was done I converted the new symbol, so I had literally two symbols
                that their only difference was, for example, that one of them had a blue paragraph element and the other
                had black. This worried me since it increased the size of the system significantly, it was hard to define
                the names of components, and in general, I was making a mess. In that moment of time, I spent some time researching
                the idea of symbol nesting.

                    With essential symbol nesting, I was able to design most of my components to follow a similar logic when used. When I had
                    to showcase some sort of interactivity with an element, I had to detach the symbols again. This is why
                    I decided to work this out the other way around - every time a repeatable interactivity pattern occurred,
                    I transformed it into symbols. With this decision, I made myself the future favor when encountering the
                    same/similar interaction pattern in the building process of other Pruvit apps.</p>

                After we had the base wireframes for the mobile, we iterated on the component placement on the page, until we found the exact
                the layout we were looking for.

                    When I began working side by side with Pruvit's team, we just started implementing new app features I remember that I designed
                    many screens that got scraped in the search of a better pattern or layout. Implementing new features
                    can be described like this - A loop of "Communicate - Itterate" with the Pruvit team. Probably the best
                    process for work being done remotely.</p>
